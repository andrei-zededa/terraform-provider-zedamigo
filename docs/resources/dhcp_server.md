# zedamigo_dhcp_server (Resource)

Create and manage a DHCP v4 server instance with a simple configuration
		that listens on a specific interface. Uses an embedded instance of CoreDHCP (https://github.com/coredhcp/coredhcp).
		NOTE: If the host has a firewall configuration that might drop incoming UDP port 67 packets. Double check that.
		This resource DOES NOT manage the host firewall configuration.

## Example Usage

```terraform
variable "intf_to_run_dhcp" {
  sensitive = false
  type      = string
  default   = "eth1"
}

resource "zedamigo_dhcp_server" "test" {
  interface  = var.intf_to_run_dhcp
  server_id  = "172.27.244.254"
  nameserver = "9.9.9.9"
  router     = "172.27.244.254"
  netmask    = "255.255.255.0"
  pool {
    start = "172.27.244.100"
    end   = "172.27.244.199"
  }
  lease_time = 3600 # Optional: lease time in seconds (default: 3600)
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `interface` (String) Interface on which to run this DHCP v4 server instance
- `nameserver` (String) IPv4 address which will be used as the value for the nameserver/DNS option in the DHCP offer.
				If a fully working setup is needed then this must be an existing & working DNS resolver.
				This resource DOES NOT provide DNS resolving.
- `netmask` (String) Netmask for the DHCP offers
- `router` (String) IPv4 address which will be used as the value for the router option in the DHCP offer.
				If a fully working setup is needed then the host must be configured to route (do NAT, etc.) correctly.
				This resource DOES NOT configure the host.
- `server_id` (String) IPv4 address representing the DHCP server ID

### Optional

- `lease_time` (Number) DHCP lease time in seconds. This determines how long a client can use an assigned IP address before needing to renew the lease.
				Defaults to 3600 seconds (1 hour).
- `pool` (Block, Optional) DHCP v4 address pool configuration for dynamic allocation (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--pool))
- `state` (String) Desired state of the DHCP server daemon. Can be "running" or "stopped".
				Defaults to "running". The provider will automatically start or stop the daemon to match this state.

### Read-Only

- `config_file` (String) The auto-generated CoreDHCP configuration file
- `id` (String) DHCP server resource identifier.
- `leases_file` (String) The sqlite3 leases file used by this instance of CoreDHCP
- `pid_file` (String) Process ID file

<a id="nestedblock--pool"></a>
### Nested Schema for `pool`

Required:

- `end` (String) DHCP v4 pool last IPv4 address for dynamic allocation
- `start` (String) DHCP v4 pool first IPv4 address for dynamic allocation
