# zedamigo_vlan (Resource)

Create and manage a Linux network VLAN sub-interface on a specific parent interface. This is done using iproute2 commands.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "zedamigo_tap" "test-tap" {
  name  = "test-tap"
  mtu   = "1500"
  state = "up"
}

# NOTE: If the test-tap interface is not in use by a process then it's state
# will be `down`. This causes a failure when trying to set the state of the
# sub-interface to `up`. If it's parent interface would be something like `eth0`
# and that interface is `up` then we can also set the sub-interface state to `up`.
resource "zedamigo_vlan" "v2000" {
  parent       = "test-tap"
  vlan_id      = 2000
  mtu          = "1500"
  state        = "down" # Usually this would be set to `up`.
  ipv4_address = "172.27.203.225/27"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `parent` (String) Parent interface on which to create this VLAN sub-interface
- `vlan_id` (Number) VLAN ID for this sub-interface

### Optional

- `ipv4_address` (String) IPv4 address to configure on the VLAN sub-interface
- `mtu` (Number) MTU size for the VLAN sub-interface
- `state` (String) State of the VLAN sub-interface (up/down)

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) VLAN resource identifier. This is not the VLAN ID, since we can have multiple sub-interfaces with the same VLAN ID on different parent interfaces.
- `name` (String) Full name of the resuling interface (e.g. `${parent}.${vlanid}`).
