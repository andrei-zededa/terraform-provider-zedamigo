# zedamigo_dhcp6_server (Resource)

Create and manage a DHCP v6 server instance with a simple configuration
		that listens on a specific interface. Uses an embedded instance of CoreDHCP (https://github.com/coredhcp/coredhcp).
		NOTE: If the host has a firewall configuration that might drop incoming UDP port 547 packets. Double check that.
		This resource DOES NOT manage the host firewall configuration.

## Example Usage

```terraform
variable "intf_to_run_dhcp6" {
  sensitive = false
  type      = string
  default   = "eth1"
}

resource "zedamigo_dhcp6_server" "test" {
  interface  = var.intf_to_run_dhcp6
  server_id  = "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff"
  prefix     = "fd00:abcd:1234::/64"
  nameserver = "2606:4700:4700::1111"
  pool_start = "fd00:abcd:1234::100"
  pool_end   = "fd00:abcd:1234::199"
  lease_time = 3600 # Optional: lease time in seconds (default: 3600)
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `interface` (String) Interface on which to run this DHCP v6 server instance
- `nameserver` (String) IPv6 address which will be used as the value for the nameserver/DNS option in the DHCP offer.
				If a fully working setup is needed then this must be an existing & working DNS resolver.
				This resource DOES NOT provide DNS resolving.
- `pool_end` (String) DHCP v6 pool last IPv6 address for dynamic allocation
- `pool_start` (String) DHCP v6 pool first IPv6 address for dynamic allocation
- `server_id` (String) MAC address representing the DHCPv6 server ID

### Optional

- `lease_time` (Number) DHCPv6 lease time in seconds. This determines how long a client can use an assigned IPv6 address before needing to renew the lease.
				Defaults to 3600 seconds (1 hour).
- `prefix` (String) Prefix delegation
- `state` (String) Desired state of the DHCPv6 server daemon. Can be "running" or "stopped".
				Defaults to "running". The provider will automatically start or stop the daemon to match this state.

### Read-Only

- `config_file` (String) The auto-generated CoreDHCP configuration file
- `id` (String) DHCPv6 server resource identifier.
- `leases_file` (String) The sqlite3 leases file used by this instance of CoreDHCP
- `pid_file` (String) Process ID file
