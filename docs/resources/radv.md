# zedamigo_radv (Resource)

Create and manage an IPv6 Router Advertisement daemon for a specific interface.
		This resource sends periodic Router Advertisements (RAs) according to RFC 4861, enabling IPv6 autoconfiguration
		for clients on the network. Uses the github.com/mdlayher/ndp library.
		NOTE: This resource DOES NOT configure IP forwarding or firewall rules.

## Example Usage

```terraform
variable "intf_to_advertise" {
  sensitive = false
  type      = string
  default   = "eth1"
}

# Basic SLAAC setup.
resource "zedamigo_radv" "slaac" {
  interface         = var.intf_to_advertise
  prefix            = "fd00:abcd:1234::/64"
  dns_servers       = "2606:4700:4700::1111,2606:4700:4700::1001"
  prefix_autonomous = true  # Allow SLAAC.
  managed_config    = false # Don't require DHCPv6 for addresses.
  other_config      = false # Don't require DHCPv6 for other config.
}

# DHCPv6 only (SLAAC disabled).
resource "zedamigo_radv" "dhcpv6_only" {
  interface         = "eth2"
  prefix            = "fd00:1111:2222::/64"
  prefix_autonomous = false # Disable SLAAC.
  managed_config    = true  # Use DHCPv6 for addresses.
  other_config      = true  # Use DHCPv6 for other config.
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `interface` (String) Interface on which to send Router Advertisements
- `prefix` (String) IPv6 prefix to advertise in Router Advertisements.
				This prefix will be used by clients for SLAAC (if prefix_autonomous is true).
				Example: 'fd00:abcd:1234::/64'

### Optional

- `dns_servers` (String) DNS server addresses to advertise via RDNSS option (RFC 8106).
				Multiple servers can be separated by commas. Example: '2606:4700:4700::1111,2606:4700:4700::1001'
- `hop_limit` (Number) The default value that should be placed in the Hop Count field of the IP header for outgoing packets. Default: 64
- `managed_config` (Boolean) When true, tells clients to use DHCPv6 for address assignment.
				Set to true when using DHCPv6 for addresses instead of SLAAC. Default: false
- `max_interval` (Number) Maximum time allowed between sending unsolicited Router Advertisements. RFC 4861 recommends 600 seconds. Default: 600
- `min_interval` (Number) Minimum time allowed between sending unsolicited Router Advertisements. RFC 4861 recommends at least 3 seconds and at most 0.75 * max_interval. Default: 200
- `other_config` (Boolean) When true, tells clients to use DHCPv6 for other configuration
				(e.g., DNS, NTP) beyond addresses. Default: false
- `prefix_autonomous` (Boolean) When true, indicates that this prefix can be used for stateless address
				autoconfiguration (SLAAC). Set to false if you want to use DHCPv6 only for addressing. Default: true
- `prefix_on_link` (Boolean) When true, indicates that this prefix can be used for on-link determination.
				Typically set to true. Default: true
- `prefix_preferred_lifetime` (Number) Length of time in seconds that addresses generated from the prefix remain preferred. Default: 14400 (4 hours)
- `prefix_valid_lifetime` (Number) Length of time in seconds that the prefix is valid. Default: 86400 (24 hours)
- `router_lifetime` (Number) Lifetime associated with the default router in seconds. Default: 1800 (30 minutes)
- `state` (String) Desired state of the RADV daemon. Can be "running" or "stopped".
				Defaults to "running". The provider will automatically start or stop the daemon to match this state.

### Read-Only

- `config_file` (String) The auto-generated RADV configuration file
- `id` (String) RADV resource identifier.
- `pid_file` (String) Process ID file
